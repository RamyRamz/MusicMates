        <p>MusicMates Inc. is the winner of the 2015 International Day of Persons with Disabilities Access Award in Kingston.</p>
        <p>As a not-for-profit organization, MusicMates is dedicated to creating social opportunities for children, youth and adults through music.
        Director Shera Lumsden has seen the difference music makes in the emotional, physical and social development of children, youth and adults with special needs.</p>
        <p>“It’s really nice to be recognized because we’ve been working really hard for about five years now,” Lumsden said. “On the other hand, I know most of the people who are nominated and we all work together, very much as a team, so I’m glad that everyone’s been recognized.”</p>
        <p>The programming uses music to encourage social skills and create friendships.
        “Music acts as an equalizer and it’s so accessible,” Lumsden said. “We’re trying to connect people through music.”
        MusicMates programs give children, youth and adults the opportunity to make friends, learn sign language, and practise important social skills, all through the use of music.</p>
        <p>“People don’t realize that we’re portable, that we’ll come to them,” Lumsden said. “Accessibility is becoming more about the full spectrum of needs. We’re now facilitating communication for people, not only putting ramps on buildings but we’re thinking about how can we be accessible 100 per cent.”
        The winner and recognition awards were presented during a public ceremony at the Invista Centre Thursday.</p>
        <p>The winner was chosen by the City of Kingston in partnership with the municipal accessibility advisory committee. There are four criteria the committee uses to help make its decision between five completely deserving applicants.</p>
        <p>“It’s really, really hard to choose … so we try to measure the applicants against the criteria because it’s so hard to choose,” Drew Kennedy, chair of the municipal accessibility advisory committee, said. “The overview of the criteria that’s considered by the selection committee to evaluate for the Access Award would include: the degree to which the initiative demonstrates innovation and creativity; the degree to which it enhances accessibility; the degree to which it improves the quality of life for persons with disabilities; and the impact the initiative has on developing and delivering interesting awareness about disability and accessibility issues.”</p>
        <p>The four other groups that received a nomination and recognition were Driving Miss Daisy, The Independent Living Centre of Kingston, St. Joseph’s Catholic Churc,h and Y2K-Kingston Youth Strategy.</p>
        <p>“The more important piece is that everybody gets recognition and it brings all of them together to meet and get to know each other,” Kennedy said. “It lets them do some problem-solving, coaching and sharing. It’s the broader benefit and it’s the key thing for the committee, not to take anything from the award winner.”</p>
        <p>Last year, the Access Award was given to Kingston 4 Paws Service Dogs, a unique not-for-profit service that trains dogs for people with a range of disabilities, including autism, seizures, post-traumatic stress disorder, mobility challenges and other challenges.</p>
        <p>The International Day of Persons with Disabilities Access Award was created in 2011 and “recognizes a person, group or organization making a significant contribution beyond legislated requirements, towards improving access for persons with disabilities in Kingston.”</p>

          <h3 class="modal-title">Musician to Ring in Concert with Bell Performance</h3>
        </div> <!-- header-->
        <div class="modal-body">
          <p>When the members of the Shout Sister Choir asked Shera Lumsden if she had anyone who could do a guest performance at a concert they were holding to raise money for Lumsden’s MusicMates, a program of music instruction for children, youth and adults with special needs, one name came to mind.</p>
          <p>“I immediately thought of Greg.”</p>
          <p>“Greg” is Greg Robson, who was born blind and was diagnosed as having Conradi-Hunermann syndrome, an extremely rare disorder that affects skeletal development and hampers growth. It can also result in intellectual disabilities and, in Robson’s case, he became autistic.</p>
          <p>Greg is now 43. He didn’t learn to walk until he was 10. He wasn’t toilet-trained until he was 11.</p>
          <p>“He learned to talk from the Wheel of Fortune,” said his mother, Cynthia.</p>
          <p>Greg was always anxious, so, to provide soothing background noise, they always had to have the radio on or the vacuum cleaner running.</p>
          <p>“I had the cleanest house in town,” Cynthia said.</p>
          <p>Greg never wanted to be left alone but didn’t like to be coddled.</p>
          <p>“He was not a cuddly child. He never liked to be held,” Cynthia said.</p>
          <p>They were able to get him into a school for the blind, the first special needs child to be admitted.</p>
          <p>“He just loved going to school. He learned a lot.”</p>
          <p>Greg was there for two and a half years before moving to Loyalist Collegiate when he was 13.</p>
          <p>High school didn’t work out as well, Cynthia said. He was just going through the motions.</p>
          <p>So they looked for something else to spark his interest.</p>
          <p>“We always had to bring the world to him. His world is basically just his body and what he can touch.”</p>
          <p>Cynthia had been raised by a blind woman, so she knew the abilities can be there — you just have to reach them.</p>
          <p>They had bought Greg “an old clunker of a piano that stood as high as the house,” but it was a bit of a struggle at first to get him to stay on the stool. They persevered, and Greg is now in his 20th year of taking piano lessons.</p>
          <p>About three years ago, Greg was going through a particularly bad time. His behaviour was proving to be a problem, so the Robsons again looked for help.
          Cynthia had read about MusicMates and called Shera Lumsden to see if she would meet Greg and help him through music.</p>
          <p>Lumsden knew right away he was special.</p>
          <p>“I saw there was so much more,” Lumsden said.</p>
          <p>He was playing by ear and had near-perfect pitch.</p>
          <p>Coming out to his house for three hours every Wednesday, Lumsden tried him on several different types of instruments, but the desk bells seemed to work the best.</p>
          <p>They started out with five, but Greg soon mastered them and wanted more. Eventually, they were working with so many they needed a bigger table to put them all on.</p>
          <p>Greg’s desire to play was endless.</p>
          <p>“He could go all day. It’s just one song after another,” Lumsden said.
          They packed away the bells after class, but Greg would play his keyboard until the wee hours of the morning when mom and dad had to shut him down so they could get some sleep.</p>
          <p>Lumsden began to add a little music theory to the sessions and Greg picked it right up.</p>
          <p>“He just grows and grows and keeps on growing. I have no doubt he can continue to learn. Once he understands what he is hearing, he is just going to fly.”
          The playing is also helping his social skills and his gross motor skills as he masters the arm movements needed to play the bells, adopts a better posture and raises his hands after tapping each bell to let it ring out loud and strong.
          Since he is blind, he has to memorize where each bell is located in front of him.
          Lumsden was particularly impressed with Greg’s ability to immediately pick up on any song she played.</p>
          <p>“You name a song and he plays it.”</p>
          <p>He just has to hear it once “and he has got it.”</p>
          <p>Even if he has never heard it before, he seems to know where the melody is going and can jump right in, Lumsden said.</p>
          <p>His skill has even impressed some of the professional musicians Lumsden brings in to her MusicMates sessions.</p>
          <p>“They were blown away.”</p>
          <p>Greg started out with short little ditties and now plays classical numbers. They figure he now knows about 400 songs.</p>
          <p>“He is so dedicated to learning,” Lumsden said. “He loves to learn. He could sit all day and all night learning.”</p>
          <p>The classes have made a “big time” difference “in his happiness and his confidence,” Cynthia said. Greg is not as anxious all the time.
          “He just calms right down when it’s time to start music,” agreed Lumsden.
          Greg’s dedication made him the obvious choice when the Shout Sister Choir asked for someone to open their concert.</p>
          <p>It will be held Tuesday, June 9, at Sydenham Street United Church, beginning at 7:30 p.m. Tickets cost $10 and are available at the door.</p>
          <p>Each year, the choir, which will be directed by Georgette Fry, picks a different charity as the beneficiary from its concert.</p>
          <p>Greg will be kicking off the event by playing three numbers on his bells. He is looking forward to it, said his parents.</p>
          <p>Cynthia and husband Glenn managed to look after Greg until he was 37.
          “We hung on to him really tight” and felt they were the only ones who could work with him.</p>
          <p>“But after a while, you have to say: ‘I have to let go.’”</p>
          <p>So Greg now lives in a community living residence, but he still comes home regularly.</p>
          <p>The music has really helped him grow and improve his life, Cynthia said.</p>
          <p>“You always have dreams for your children. And our dream came true. Slow, but it came true.”</p>

          <h3 class="modal-title">Unit has Users Beaming</h3>
        </div> <!-- header-->
        <div class="modal-body">
          <p>A new piece of technology is opening up a whole new world for a local group that uses music as a communication tool.</p>
          <p>Shera Lumsden founded MusicMates in 2010 as a not-for-profit organization that helped both children and adults with special needs and behaviour issues to improve their social and communication skills through music.The recent purchase of a SoundBeam 5 unit, which allows the user to make music and sounds through movement, “is one of the most exciting things I have ever been involved in,” Lumsden said.</p>
          <p>The unit includes a control panel and parts that look like microphones but emit a beam that, when broken by a hand or other body part, creates sound.
          The whole unit costs about $10,000, but part of the cost was funded by the Community Foundation for Kingston and Area. It was a request supported by such local groups as the Child Development Centre, Ongwanada, Family and Children’s Services and Community Living Kingston, Lumsden said.
          They started learning how to use the unit over the summer and will be introducing it to the public at a special event Thursday at the Playtrium on Days Road, from 6 to 8 p.m. The event is part of the Playtrium’s increased focus on the special needs community.</p>
          <p>Lumsden said they call the unit their “invisible keyboard” since the user can play musical notes by moving in a variety of ways in front of the beams. A multitude of different sounds are possible.The unit is so sensitive that even waving a single finger can produce a mini-symphony, making it ideal for people with severely limited movement.</p>
          <p>A background beat can be played, which the user can accompany with their own composition.</p>
          <p>Training someone to use the unit is time-consuming, Lumsden said. Only two of them have been trained so far.”I learn more and more about it all the time,” she said.</p>
          <p>The SoundBeam technology has been around for years. “I have been dreaming of the SoundBeam since I was young.”  It went through a variety of evolutions until the current version came out. Lumsden said she was glad she waited until it was perfected.</p>
          <p>“Because the possibilities are endless. We can use it for gross motor skills, fine motor skills, we can use it for therapy, we can use it for social skills training, story telling, social stories. We can use it for so much.” It can be programmed to play sound effects that go along with the actions when someone is reading a book to a child.</p>
          <p>Lumsden said the initial feedback has been positive and she expects children to flock to use the unit.  “When you have a program that offers technology, kids automatically want to be involved.” Add in music and you have something to which everyone can relate.</p>
          <p>Add in visual effects and it is even better. SoundBeam can be attached to an amp that features a type of disco ball that illuminates the room in time to the music. That way it can even be used with someone who is hearing impaired.</p>
          <p>“You can feel the vibration of the music. We want to do music that involves all the senses, so you can see, feel and touch the music. People don’t all experience music the same way, and if you are using this as a tool to help with all different needs, then you have to do it through all difference senses,” Lumsden said.</p>
          <p>“It just blew our minds. We thought we would be more limited than we were. Once we started using it, we thought: Oh, we can do so much more with this.”
          MusicMates, which operates out of Edith Rankin Memorial United Church, works with clients from two years old up to adults, from teenagers in group homes to developmentally disabled adults at Ongwanada, she said.</p>
          <p>Music is a great equalizer, she continued. “The music takes out any of the labelling of special needs. You just become a group of people experiencing music. Music brings down the barriers to reach people. And that’s what we do.”
          It can help reinforce the regular programs people are taking through their own community groups, she said. Getting the SoundBeam unit out into the community and sharing it with other agencies is important, Lumsden said.
          There was also another aspect to the unit.</p>
          <p>“The research possibilities are endless with this as well. I would be interested to see what Queen’s University could do with this type of unit.”</p>

            <h3 class="modal-title">Making a Connection Through Music</h3>
          </div> <!-- header-->
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>MusicMates, a Kingston non-profit organization, uses percussion 
            instruments such as bells and drums to teach communication and social 
            skills to children and adults with special needs. Most clients are 
            children who are on the autism spectrum or have developmental delays.</p>
            <p>Some of these children are in the midst of working with outside 
            specialists to develop social skills such as making eye contact, sharing
             and taking turns. The program looks to help participants work towards 
            these goals by incorporating them in a musical environment.</p>
            <p>“It’s like teaching a song and getting kids to do actions to songs. 
            Instead of doing actions, we do social skills,” said MusicMates founder 
            Shera Lumsden.</p>
            <p>Lumsden, whose daughter has an autism spectrum disorder, said adding 
            music to the mix increases a child’s desire to learn and makes it fun.</p>
            <p>“Music acts as an equalizer and takes down the walls that children build up,” she said.</p>
            <p>The hope is that skills learned through the program will be transferred into their everyday lives.</p>
            <p>The organization was founded in 2010. Since then, there have been over 300 participants.</p>
            <p>In conjunction with the music, the program teaches students sign 
            language, as most of them are non-verbal. In an average session, each 
            participant will learn 20 to 25 signs.</p>
            <p>“Children who are non-verbal hang out with their own crowd. Verbal 
            kids hang out with their own crowd. Connecting the two is pretty 
            important to us.”</p>
            <p>This, Lumsden said, is done through sign language.</p>
            <p>Special needs children and adults often face high medical expenses. 
            In response to this, the organization created a subsidy fund to help 
            clients with class fees.</p>
            <p>The subsidy will be funded by money raised at a giant yard sale, set for this Saturday at Edith Rankin Memorial Church.</p>
            <p>Both an indoor and outdoor yard sale will take place, with some 
            prices set and others by donation. All proceeds will go towards the 
            subsidy.</p>
            <p>Last year, the event raised $1,500. This year, Lumsden wants to double that number.</p>
            <p>“We had three or four people who were moving and dropped off 
            truckloads to us,” she said. The group will be accepting donations up 
            until Thursday night.</p>
            <p>“People who we don’t even know have been calling us and donating beautiful items that they could probably sell elsewhere.”</p>
            <p>This is the second year of the event. Lumsden said she’s already noticing an increased interest from community members.</p>
            <p>“What we’re working on is having people understand what we do,” she 
            said. “It’s kind of a unique concept. We do teach music skills. We do 
            teach music theory in some of our classes. But we use the music as a 
            means of achieving goals.“</p>

            <p>Making friends on the first day of a 
            new job or the first day of school can be difficult. For those with 
            special needs or social disorders, this difficulty is magnified.</p><p>One place social barriers just don't seem to exist, according to Shera Lumsden, is in music.</p><p>"The music just takes down all the walls," Lumsden said, speaking about her organization, MusicMates Inc.</p><p>About two years ago, Lumsden came up with the idea to create musical programs with one goal in mind: having fun.</p><p>Lumsden,
            who is currently studying part time at Queen's University to obtain her
             psychology and music degrees, knows well the needs of children and 
            adults who have problems socializing are hard to address. Her daughter, 
            who has an autism spectrum disorder, has a passion for opera singing, 
            and Lumsden spent years trying to find vocal lessons and classes that 
            worked for her.</p><p>"Formal lessons really didn't suit her, and for 
            basically two years, I couldn't find any way for her to sing just for 
            fun," Lumsden recalled.</p><p>After speaking with some mothers with 
            similar issues with their own children, she decided to start MusicMates,
             an organization that offers two programs for those with special needs 
            or problems socializing - Social Singing and Singing and Signing, which 
            incorporates sign language into the music the participants study. </p><p>The
             students also use musical instruments to accompany Lumsden and the 
            other teachers, who play guitar from the moment students walk in the 
            doors.</p><p>So far, all participants in the Singing and Signing program
             have been non-verbal. This can be due to a range of issues and causes, 
            from deafness to learning delays, developmental problems to trauma 
            issues.</p><p>The range of those who have found the programs helpful is 
            vast, from three to 70 years of age, some with severe mental 
            disabilities, some with social problems, delays or behavioural issues. 
            Some are just plain shy and some children have been bullied. </p><p>With
             more than 100 participants in the last year, MusicMates Inc. became a 
            registered not-for-profit group in October 2010. Now, Lumsden is pleased
             to have found her first corporate sponsor - ZealMetal, a downtown 
            custom jewelry business.</p><p>"We're just on the edge of trying to 
            expand a little bit," Lumsden said, noting that there are groups in 
            Harrowsmith and Toronto interested in starting a similar program. 
            Currently, some parents drive their children from as far away as Napanee
             to attend the programs.</p><p>The reason the demand for the programs is so high is because of how effective they are.</p><p>"It's amazing," Lumsden said.</p><p>"It's the most inspirational thing I've ever done."</p><p>Lumsden
             said she's had parents explain that they aren't sure their children 
            will take to the programs, such as those who haven't made a sound since 
            birth.</p><p>"We started using the music to teach basic sign language 
            and  speech sounds," Lumsden explained, noting that there have been 
            students who have never been able to learn sign language until taking 
            the Singing and Signing program. These non-verbal children have begun 
            signing, she said, because they see other students doing it in the 
            classes.</p><p>"They just start doing what everybody else is doing and it's just been phenomenal," she said.</p><p>Additionally, those who are in speech therapy have found the programs helpful, she said.</p><p>"When you're putting songs into music and sounds into music, you don't feel like it's work," said Lumsden.</p><p>"So it's easier to get students to  try things."</p><p>For
             Lumsden, the clearest memories from her time leading the organizations 
            are the major breakthroughs her participants have made.</p><p>"We've had
             kids who've made their first sound in our speech class," she said, 
            noting one particular boy who is in foster care and dealing with 
            depression issues.</p><p>"It took him 22 weeks, and he finally sang. Now he's the biggest participant."</p><p>To
             make the Kingston community more aware of the programs, MusicMates is 
            holding an open house on Saturday at Community Living Kingston, 1412 
            Princess St., from 1 to 3 p.m.</p><p>"I don't know if people are fully understanding what music can do," Lumsden said.</p><p>"If
             you think outside the box, music is so powerful, and to be able to use 
            it as a social vehicle is just amazing. I just want people to come and 
            experience it."</p><p>Lumsden also hopes that the community and more 
            Kingston-area businesses will come on board in supporting the 
            organization as well. Each participant's cost for the three-month 
            programs is about $140, but, through fundraising, MusicMates has never 
            had to charge full fees to their students. </p><p>MusicMates also has a subsidy fund for those in financial need.</p><p>"I really want to get the Kings­ton community behind this because everybody needs a friend," Lumsden said.</p><p>"Some
             people think that we are only for those with special needs, but we're 
            not. It's for those with social needs. If for some reason, you can't 
            make a friend, then you'll find a friend at our group."</p><p>tstafford@thewhig.com</p>

            <p>MusicMates, is a local non-profit organization committed to 
            creating interactive social opportunities for people experiencing 
            developmental challenges, such as autism, trauma survivors and children 
            who struggle making friends. These social opportunities are accomplished
             through the use of music and musical activities. MusicMates has 
            developed specific programming to assist with social skills development,
             communication, basic sign language, speech sounds and learning 
            challenges. Now with over 100 clients from age 3 to 70, MusicMates is 
            expanding in the Kingston area to include up to 200 participants with 
            the business sponsor: ZealMetal.</p>
            <p>ZealMetal, a custom jewelry business owned by Nicole Horlor, is the 
            first business to sponsor a “MusicMate” for a full session of classes. 
            Each sponsored participant will receive ten weeks of music classes, 
            cards in the mail from other MusicMate participants and a family fun 
            night at the end of the ten week program. For more info, look them up on
            Facebook under MusicMates Inc.</p>
